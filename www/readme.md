# PhoneGap API Explorer #

PhoneGap API Explorer is a tablet application that gives you access to documentation for the PhoneGap Device Integration APIs, and allows you to experiment with these APIs inside the application.

You can capture pictures, videos, and sound, track your current location, find and modify contacts, read and write local files, access a local database, and more. The application allows you to experiment with the APIs’ most frequently used parameters and see the results instantly inside the application. You can also click the “API” button and access the complete documentation for the API you are experimenting with.

The application is built with Backbone.js, and Twitter Bootstrap, and it is of course wrapped with PhoneGap.
